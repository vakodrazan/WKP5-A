# Weekend Project 5: Wiring up Onja Cookbook
 
This is the 5th javascript weekend project.
 
## What we need to do:
 
- In this project we need to create an object array that contains two arrays that nest in it.
- Generate the card when clicking the button.
- Create an event delegation for the button that was created in the javascript file.
 
### What I succeed: 
 
- Showing the card when clicking the generate the button and show a litle detail about each card.
- Create a modal in the html file and push the html that was created in the Javascript file in it.
- Create the event delegation for more information and show all the information.
- Listen to the outside modal to quit the program or press the escape key.
 
### What I didn't succeed:
 
- I tried to loop through each item inside of the two nested arrays I used `forEach()` andit works but I don't know how to call them.
- I tried to work on the ingredients and steps but I couldn't manage to get the list for each string.
 
### Additional enhance I would make if I had more time
 
- Try to work on making the item into a list.
- I started to work on the next step which is making the form and it works but I haven't finished it yet. I didn't get the result shown in the card list. I will work on that.
- Restructure the code if there is an easy way to make it.
